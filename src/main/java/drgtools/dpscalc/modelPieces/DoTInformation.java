	This class will be a standardized location for all Damage Over Time mechanics that can be applied

	these DoTs, they cannot be stacked on themselves (e.g. 2 Electrocute DoTs and 3 Fire DoTs), but they 
	do stack with each other. If a second DoT of the same type would be applied before the DoT duration 
	is done, its duration is refreshed instead.
