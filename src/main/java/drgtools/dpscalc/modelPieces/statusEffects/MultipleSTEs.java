// For the strange usecase where there are several StatusEffects being applied by one weapon to one enemy all at once
// Needs to add up the DPS, split by DMG_Element, aggregate Heat/sec, multiply the slows, etc etc
// Also needs to transparently work if there's only one STE, because that way it can be used as an entry point for Breakpoints()
